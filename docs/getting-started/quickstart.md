# Quickstart

Create a fresh remix-adonisjs project using the [Remix starter template](https://github.com/jarle/remix-starter-kit#readme):

```
npm init adonisjs -- -K="github:jarle/remix-starter-kit"
```

You should now be able to start building.
Just jump into your new folder and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
