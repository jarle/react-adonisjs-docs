# Quickstart

Create a fresh react-adonisjs project using the [React Router starter template](https://github.com/jarle/react-router-starter-kit#readme):

```
npm init adonisjs@latest -- -K="github:jarle/react-router-starter-kit"
```

You should now be able to start building!
Just jump into your new folder and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.

The project follows the conventional AdonisJS structure, with the React Router application being placed in `resources/react_app`.

A good next step could be to follow our guide on how to build a [login flow](/hands-on/building-a-login-flow.md) for your new application.

For implementation details/reference, refer to the official documentation for the two frameworks:

- [React router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/home)
- [AdonisJS documentation](https://docs.adonisjs.com/)
