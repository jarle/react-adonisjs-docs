# Quickstart

Create a fresh remix-adonisjs project using the [Remix starter template](https://github.com/jarle/remix-starter-kit#readme):

```
npm init adonisjs@latest -- -K="github:jarle/remix-starter-kit"
```

You should now be able to start building!
Just jump into your new folder and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.

The project follows the conventional AdonisJS structure, with the Remix application being placed in `resources/remix_app`.

For implementation details/reference, refer to the official documentation for the two frameworks:
- [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/)
- [AdonisJS documentation](https://docs.adonisjs.com/)
